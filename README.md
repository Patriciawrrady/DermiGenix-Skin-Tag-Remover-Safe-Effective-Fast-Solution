<h3>How Does DermiGenix Skin Tag Remover Work?</h3>
<p>DermiGenix Skin Tag Remover works by using a blend of natural ingredients that target the root cause of skin tags. The formula is designed to penetrate the skin and gently dry out the skin tag. Over time, the skin tag shrinks and eventually falls off, leaving behind smooth, clear skin.</p>
<p>The active ingredients in DermiGenix include essential oils and plant extracts known for their skin-healing properties. These ingredients are known to be effective in treating skin irregularities, including skin tags. As the product dries the skin tag, it helps to dissolve the cells holding the skin tag in place, causing it to loosen and eventually fall off naturally.</p>
<h3>How to Use DermiGenix Skin Tag Remover</h3>
<p>Using DermiGenix Skin Tag Remover is simple and straightforward. Follow these steps for optimal results:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean the Affected Area</strong> Begin by washing the area around the skin tag with warm water and soap to remove any dirt or oils. Pat the skin dry with a clean towel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply the Solution</strong> Take a small amount of DermiGenix Skin Tag Remover and apply it directly to the skin tag using a cotton swab or your fingertip. Be sure to cover the entire skin tag with the solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Allow the Product to Work</strong> Let the solution sit on the skin tag for a few minutes. You may begin to feel a slight tingling sensation, which is normal. Do not rub or wipe the area off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Repeat the Process</strong> Apply the solution once or twice daily for best results. Continue this process until the skin tag falls off. This may take anywhere from several days to a week, depending on the size of the skin tag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aftercare</strong> Once the skin tag has fallen off, you can continue to use DermiGenix Skin Tag Remover on the area for a few more days to ensure the skin heals properly and remains clear. If you notice any irritation, stop using the product and consult a dermatologist.</p>
</li>
</ol>
